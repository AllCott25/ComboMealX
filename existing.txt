- Refined the hint vessel absorption logic to be more selective:
  - Now ONLY considers yellow vessels (partial combinations) for absorption
  - Explicitly excludes white vessels (base ingredients) from automatic absorption
  - Added a check to ensure ALL ingredients in a vessel match the hint requirements
  - Simplified the removal logic since we now only absorb vessels where all ingredients match
- Improved the validation criteria:
  - Added a strict check that the number of matching ingredients equals the total ingredients in the vessel

**Solution:**
- Completely rewrote the logic for combining base ingredients with completed combinations (Case 3 in combineVessels function)
- Implemented a more robust validation system that checks if the combination is valid for any recipe:
  - For final recipe: Checks if both the base ingredient and the completed combination are required components
  - For intermediate recipes: Checks if the base ingredients can be combined with the completed combination to form a valid recipe
- Added detailed validation to ensure only valid combinations are allowed:
  - Base ingredients must be part of the same recipe as the completed combination
  - Combinations must contribute toward a specific target recipe (either final or intermediate)
  - Invalid combinations are now properly rejected with appropriate console messages
- Enhanced the handling of different recipe types:

  - A yellow circular modal dialogue appears with:
    - Small text at top: "You found the egg!"
    - Large bold text in middle: [Easter Egg Name]
