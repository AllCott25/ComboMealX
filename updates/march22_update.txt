## Changes Made
- Improved floral background pattern centering (v0.0322.05):
  - Redesigned pattern generation to ensure flowers are centered symmetrically
  - Modified the left and right side background patterns to start from the center of available space
  - Updated top and bottom floral borders to also be centered from the middle of the screen
  - Added logic to ensure patterns extend just past screen edges for complete coverage
  - Fixed issue where patterns had uneven spacing on different sides of the play area

- Fixed floral pattern overlap with play area (v0.0322.06):
  - Added safety margin to prevent flowers from overlapping with the play area
  - Ensured at least one row of spacing between flowers and the play area
  - Adjusted boundary conditions to respect the new safety margins
  - Improved top/bottom flower positioning with minimum distance requirements

## Technical Implementation
- Updated the `drawFloralBorder` function to:
  - Calculate center points for left and right side spaces
  - Generate flowers working outward from the center in both directions
  - Skip flowers that would be completely off-screen
  - Add a safety margin equal to one flower spacing (40px)
  - Properly adjust calculation boundaries to respect margins

- Updated the `drawTopBottomFlowers` function to:
  - Find the center point of the screen width
  - Place flowers symmetrically outward in both directions
  - Add proper spacing between flowers and play area
  - Use max() function to ensure adequate spacing regardless of screen dimensions

## Results
The floral background pattern now appears perfectly centered on both sides of the play area with proper spacing. The pattern maintains a clean, non-overlapping distance from the play area, creating a more visually balanced and aesthetically pleasing design regardless of screen size.
