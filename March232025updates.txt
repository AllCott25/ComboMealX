ComboMeal5 Updates - March 23, 2025 09:36:00
Updated by APlasker

Changes made:
1. Created a dedicated letter score interaction handler to improve click detection reliability on both desktop and mobile.
2. Implemented proper coordinate checking for letter score area interaction across all input methods.
3. Enhanced the mousePressed function to use the new dedicated handler for consistent behavior.
4. Updated the touchStarted function to use the same handler, improving cross-device consistency.
5. Improved the touchMoved function with more precise coordinate-based hover states and fallbacks.
6. Added detailed debug logging to help diagnose interaction issues.
7. Made the system more robust by checking for undefined variables during initialization.
8. Fixed variable scope issues by making score position variables global instead of local to the drawWinScreen function.
9. Added defensive error handling to prevent crashes when variables aren't properly initialized.
10. Fixed missing recipe_data global variable that was causing errors in the shareScore function.
11. Replaced alert with a more modern toast notification when copying score to clipboard.
12. Added comprehensive error handling throughout the sharing flow.

The improved interaction system provides several benefits:
- More reliable detection of clicks/touches on the letter score area
- Consistent behavior between mouse and touch inputs
- Better visual feedback with accurate hover states
- Simplified code maintenance with a single source of truth for interaction logic
- Improved error handling and robustness
- Enhanced user experience with non-intrusive toast notifications

These changes ensure that the letter score area responds correctly to both mouse clicks and touch interactions across all devices.

## v0.0323.05 - March 23, 2025 (10:45 EDT) by APlasker
1. Fixed the isAPlus variable issue in the shareScore function by making it global
2. Removed duplicate variable declarations at the bottom of the file
3. Enhanced error handling in score sharing functionality

The sharing functionality has been significantly improved with these changes. Now A+ grades will properly show the star emoji in the sharing text, and the previously encountered error has been resolved.

## v0.0323.06 - March 23, 2025 (11:30 EDT) by APlasker
1. Made letterGrade a global variable to fix the remaining issue with score sharing
2. Added debug logging to the shareScore function to help diagnose issues
3. Implemented fallback defaults in case variables aren't properly initialized
4. Added defensive programming to ensure the share feature works even with missing data

These changes increase the robustness of the score sharing functionality by ensuring that both isAPlus and letterGrade variables are accessible throughout the application and by adding appropriate fallbacks when the variables are undefined.

## v0.0323.07 - March 23, 2025 (12:15 EDT) by APlasker
1. Fixed critical issue with letter score click detection
2. Enhanced mousePressed to use both isMouseOverLetterScore flag AND coordinate checks
3. Updated touchStarted with the same robust detection approach
4. Improved event handling by returning false after click to prevent browser defaults

This update fundamentally changes how we detect clicks on the letter score. Instead of relying on the handleLetterScoreInteraction function to both detect clicks and handle them, we now do robust detection directly in the mousePressed and touchStarted functions. This ensures maximum reliability since we check both the hover state flag AND the actual coordinates.

## v0.0323.08 - March 23, 2025 (12:45 EDT) by APlasker
1. Improved the handleLetterScoreInteraction function with more forgiving click detection
2. Added 10px of padding around the clickable area for better user experience
3. Enhanced error handling with try-catch around the shareScore call
4. Added more detailed logging to help diagnose interaction issues

This minimal update focuses specifically on making the letter score interaction function more robust and forgiving. By adding padding to the clickable area and improving error handling, we've made it easier to hit the target and ensured that any errors in the share function are properly caught and logged.

## v0.0323.09 - March 23, 2025 (13:15 EDT) by APlasker
1. Fixed the TypeError in shareScore function by removing the Web Share API call
2. Now using the clipboard functionality directly for more reliable sharing
3. Added additional logging for better diagnostics
4. Simplified the code path to eliminate error-prone browser API

This update directly addresses the specific error shown in console logs: "TypeError: Type error" in the share function. By removing the Web Share API call entirely and relying on the more widely supported clipboard API, we've eliminated the source of the error while maintaining the sharing functionality in a more reliable way.

## v0.0323.10 - March 23, 2025 (13:45 EDT) by APlasker
1. Enhanced the share text to include the game URL: https://allcott25.github.io/ComboMeal/
2. Improved the toast notification for better visibility:
   - More prominent green background
   - Larger font size and bold text
   - Added emoji and clearer messaging
   - Increased display time to 3 seconds
   - Enhanced with a subtle drop shadow
3. Refined styling with better spacing and padding
4. Added a small delay to ensure the toast appears properly

This final update focuses on improving the user experience for sharing scores. By including the game URL in the share text, players can easily invite friends to play. The enhanced toast notification provides clear feedback that the score has been copied to the clipboard and is ready to share.

## v0.0323.11 - March 23, 2025 (14:15 EDT) by APlasker
1. Fixed critical issue with toast notification not displaying
2. Added proper link to css/style.css in index.html
3. Ensured toast messages are now visible when sharing scores

This update resolves the issue where the toast notification was properly coded but not visible to users. The toast styling existed in css/style.css but this file wasn't linked in the HTML document. By adding the proper link, users will now see the green notification at the bottom of the screen when they share their scores, providing clear feedback that the sharing action was successful.

## v0.0323.12 - March 23, 2025 (14:30 EDT) by APlasker
1. Updated toast notification styling with avocado green background
2. Changed toast message to "üçΩÔ∏è Score copied! Share your food! üçΩÔ∏è"
3. Better alignment with the game's food theme and color scheme

This small but important update brings the toast notification fully in line with the game's visual identity. By using the signature avocado green color from the game's palette and updating the message with food-themed emojis, the notification now feels like a natural part of the Combo Meal experience.
