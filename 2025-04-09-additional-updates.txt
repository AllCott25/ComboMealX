COMBO MEAL UPDATES ADDENDUM - April 9, 2025 (20:14 EDT) by APlasker

VARIABLE SCOPE FIXES
===================

Fixed issues related to variable scoping that were causing runtime errors in the modular code:

Key Changes:
-----------
1. Fixed variable scope in main.js and game-mechanics.js:
   - Added proper checks for the "totalHeight" variable that was causing "totalHeight is not defined" errors
   - Ensured all variables are properly defined within their appropriate scope
   - Added fallback values where variables might be undefined

2. General error recovery improvements:
   - Added safety checks for undefined variables
   - Implemented defensive coding practices with null/undefined checks before using values
   - Created fallback values for critical variables to ensure resilience

3. Identified potential similar issues:
   - Reviewed all global variable usages for similar scope issues
   - Added parameter validation throughout the codebase
   - Improved error handling for critical drawing functions

GLOBAL VARIABLE AUDIT
====================

Completed an audit of global variables across the codebase to identify potential issues:

Findings:
--------
1. Variables to watch:
   - totalRows/totalHeight in arrangeVessels function (game-mechanics.js) - locally scoped, needs to stay that way
   - animation_list in main.js - needs to be properly initialized and checked before use
   - playAreaX, playAreaY, playAreaWidth, playAreaHeight - critical values used across modules

2. Recommendations for future development:
   - Use parameter passing instead of global references when possible
   - Add validation checks before using potentially undefined values
   - Apply consistent error handling to all functions that access shared state
   - Consider creating getter/setter functions for critical shared variables

ERROR HANDLING BEST PRACTICES
===========================

Implemented these best practices for error handling throughout the codebase:

1. Proper try/catch blocks surrounding all critical functionality
2. Fallback values for all rendering parameters
3. Graceful degradation of functionality when errors occur
4. Proper error logging to help diagnose issues
5. Validating input parameters before use
6. Using safe defaults when values are missing

Testing Instructions:
------------------
1. Test by intentionally introducing errors in the console to see how the game reacts
2. Try entering incorrect values for parameters to see if they are properly handled
3. Verify that the game continues to function even when components fail
4. Check that error messages are properly logged to the console
5. Verify that mouse/touch interactions remain functional during error states

Note: These updates complement the error handling improvements already implemented earlier today, with a specific focus on variable scope and potential undefined variable issues.
