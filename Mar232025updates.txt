UPDATE 1: Color Consistency for Counter Display (13:59 EDT)
- Updated the counter color in the moveHistory to use COLORS.vesselHint instead of the hardcoded '#FF5252'
- Modified the drawMoveHistory filter to recognize both colors during transition
- This ensures visual consistency between the hint vessel and its associated counters 

UPDATE 2: Counter Positioning Fix (14:04 EDT)
- Modified drawMoveHistory function to prevent counters from overlapping with the hint vessel
- Added a safety margin calculation to ensure counters always appear below the hint vessel
- Implemented a simple Math.max approach to maintain the original position when possible

UPDATE 3: Counter Visibility Enhancement (14:10 EDT)
- Added a maximum height constraint for counter positioning
- Ensures counters are always visible within the play area
- Fixed an issue where counters might be positioned too low on the screen 

UPDATE 4: Improved Visual Spacing (14:15 EDT)
- Increased the safety margin between hint vessel and counters
- Implemented an adaptive spacing calculation (8% of play area height with 60px minimum)
- Provides better visual separation between interface elements 

UPDATE 5: Fixed Positioning Implementation (14:20 EDT)
- Simplified the positioning logic for both hint button/vessel and counters
- Set the hint button to always appear at 85% from top of play area
- Positioned counters at fixed 92% from top of play area
- Eliminated complex calculations for more reliable display across different screen sizes
